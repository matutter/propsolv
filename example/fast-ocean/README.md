MAPS-Backend
============
MyAssetPipelineServer
MAPs is a node.js asset pipeline that handles basic MIMEtypes gracefully in addition to
a simple socket.io implementation and basic access to node's child-process interface. 

Is a generic node.js app for making static pages that do dynamic things with socket io.
Perfect for a 1 page interactive website.
The demo page in html/index.html demonstrates how anything can be executed through MAPS.
